<h1>Trump Tariffs Information</h1>
<p>Summary of the latest information available on Trump's tariffs as of April 15, 2025:</p>

<h2>General Overview:</h2>
<ul>
<li>President Trump views tariffs as a key part of his foreign policy, aiming to protect national security and stimulate domestic production.</li>
<li>His "America First Trade Policy" seeks to utilize tariffs and related measures to achieve its goals.</li>
<li>A baseline tariff of 10% is imposed on all countries, effective April 5, 2025.</li>
<li>This baseline can be superseded by country-specific rates.</li>
<li>The administration is open to negotiating deals, framing tariffs as a tactic to reach better agreements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reciprocal Tariffs:</h2>
<ul>
<li>President Trump will impose individualized, higher reciprocal tariffs on countries with the largest trade deficits with the U.S.</li>
<li>These higher tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025.</li>
<li>The reciprocal tariffs were suspended for all countries except China until July 9, 2025, reverting to the 10% baseline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific Tariffs and Actions:</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Potential New Tariffs:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Commerce Secretary has initiated investigations into the national security effects of pharmaceuticals/ingredients and semiconductors/chip-making equipment, potentially leading to tariffs in these sectors.</li>
<li>Trump has specifically mentioned potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economic Impact and Justification:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The White House argues tariffs will increase U.S. competitiveness, protect sovereignty, and strengthen national and economic security.</li>
<li>They also say tariffs incentivize U.S. consumers to buy American-made products.</li>
<li>A 2024 study cited by the White House suggests Trump's first-term tariffs strengthened the U.S. economy and led to reshoring.</li>
<li>Another analysis suggests a global 10% tariff could grow the economy, create jobs, and increase household incomes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Countermeasures:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Other countries have announced or implemented counter-tariffs in response to U.S. actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Considerations:</h2>
<ul>
